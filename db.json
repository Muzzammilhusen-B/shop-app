It also has some neat touches including a notification LED, 3.5mm audio socket, and stereo speakers. It's available in three variants, with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Performance in everyday tasks is good, and even gaming posed no problem. The back of the phone doesn't get too warm when stressed. Camera performance was somewhat disappointing in the daytime and at night, especially the fact that the three secondary rear cameras are quite ordinary. 4K video came out looking discoloured and there's no stabilisation. Battery life on the other hand was impressive. "

However, the 5.8-inch AMOLED panel is a first for any iPhone. Overall, the iPhone X display is great. The notch at the top contains the front camera and 3D sensors that make Face ID recognition possible. It works seamlessly and reliably on most occasions."
